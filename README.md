# Leaves classification

- Data retrieved from an old kaggle competition. Binary images of 1584 leaves and 64 attributes obtained by processing margin, shape and texture for test and train data.


# Techniques employed
- Feature extraction: leaf ratios and convexity hull algorithms were used to generate more useful data from the images.
- Principal Component Analysis P= 20 was applied to the binary representations of the images
- Logistic Regression with parameters fine-tuned with Grid Search CV was built
- K-fold 5 cross validation to train model
- Other models explored: Kmeans, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbours

# Results
- Accuracy 97%
- Misclassifications of validation set were mostly due to outliers in data generated by convexity hulls
